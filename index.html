        <section id="about">
          <p>NodeTogether is an initiative to improve the diversity of the Node community by bringing people of underepresented groups together to learn Node.js. NodeTogether is brought to you by <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">npm</a> and the <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/foundation/">Node.js Foundation</a>.</p>
          <p>We have learned from countless stories of students and mentors that our tech community loses many beginners to difficulties in the initial setup. NodeTogether seeks to make that experience better by pairing students with mentors who are expert open source contributors and to mitigate the frustration of going through the initial process alone.</p>
          <p><em>We’re in it together!</em></p>

            <h2>Students</h2>
            <p>The ideal student for a NodeTogether event is a new or junior developer who is interested in getting started with Node.js. We don’t expect you to have any programming experience and will be spending a lot of time getting a development environment set up.</p>
            <p>Additionally, we are particularly interested in people from underrepresented groups, including but not limited to, women, people of color, people with physical or mental handicaps, and LGBTQ identifying people.</p>

            <h2>Volunteers</h2>
            <p>A key component to the success of NodeTogether is partnering with the local community to bring in empathetic and energetic mentors. No teaching experience is required, but it certainly is a plus!</p>
            <p>This is your chance to give back to the community and get in touch with exciting new programming talents. Don’t be shy! Everyone’s experience is valuable, and so is yours.</p>
