        <p>NodeTogether is an initiative brought to you by npm and the Node.js Foundation. Focused on improving the diversity of the Node community, NodeTogether focuses on bringing people underepresented groups together to learn Node.js.</p>
        <p>It would be impossible to quantify how many beginners the tech community loses to the difficult of initial setup, but it is clear from the countless stories of students and mentors that it is a large percentage of those who try. NodeTogether seeks to make that experience better by pairing students with mentors who are expert open soruce contributors in the Node.js community...and when we can't make the experience better, we seek to mitigate experiencing that frustration alone.</p>
        <p>We're in it together!</p>

        <h2>Students</h2>
        <p>The ideal student for a NodeTogether event is a new or junior developer who is interested in getting started with Node.js. We don't anticipate you have any programming experience and will be spending a lot of time getting a development environment set up.</p>
        <p>Additionally, we are particularly interested in people from underrepresented groups, including but not limited to, women, people of color, people with physical or mental handicaps, and LGBTQ identifying people.</p>
